Use pushpin.sql to import DB and tables

account Table columns:
- account_id: the unique identifier of the account (this is the table’s primary key)  
- account_name: the name used for logging in, or simply “username” (each name must be unique inside the table)  
- account_passwd: the password hash, created with password_hash() 
- account_reg_time: the registration timestamp (when the account has been created)  
- account_enabled: whether the account is enabled or disabled, useful for disabling the account without deleting it from the database

===============================================================

account_sessions Table Columns:

- session_id: the PHP Session ID of the authenticated client (this is also the primary key)
- account_id: the ID of the account (pointing to the account_id column of the accounts table)
- login_time: the timestamp of the session login (useful to handle session timeouts)
